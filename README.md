This is a first attempt to use Embedded Python in IRIS  
The Python code is adapted from solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) contest.  
Test data are all input to my personal challenge.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 

Clone/git pull this repo into any local directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rcemper/try_embedded_python  
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:
```
$ docker-compose build
```
this may take some time to complete

Run the IRIS container with this project:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## How to Test it

Using IRIS terminal:
```
$ docker-compose exec iris iris session iris "##class(rccpy.AoC20).Run()"

Welcome to embedded Python Demo

```
## Hints  
Directory __.stream/__ contains all my input files and some public test data.  
If you want to use your personal input you should replace them as 1 file by day.  
e.g. input01.txt, input02.txt,........ ,input25.txt exactly as downloaded from AOC2020.  

__%SYS.Python.html__ is a preliminary class docu to see available functions

__run time__: for most tests replies are pretty immediate.  
But a few tests take quite long time for calculations before showing a reaction.   
Don't get nervous for day 11, 15!!, 17, 19, 22, 23.
